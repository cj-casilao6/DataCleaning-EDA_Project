# Overview
Start by getting a raw Excel file and then importing it into MySQL. Started by cleaning data using by creating multiple staging tables paired with SQL queries all meant to clean the data. After cleaning the data, move onto EDA by creating more SQL queries that find important information regarding numerous companies that underwent layoffs.

# Data Cleaning
After importing the raw excel table into MySQL, perform multiple SQL queries with the ultimate goal to standardize/clean data. 

**Steps for Data Cleaning:**

0) Create a duplicate table of dataset to avoid manipulating the imported table
1) Identify & delete duplicate row(s)
2) Standardizing data
3) Handle blank/NULL values
